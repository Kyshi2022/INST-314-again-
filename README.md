## Project 6: Data collection and sharing (statistics in sociology)
In a survey, 10 participants were asked to score their level of agreement with three different feminisms — difference-denying, difference-removing, and difference-honoring — on a scale of 1 to 10. Their replies are included in this dataset. Age, gender, and occupation were among the demographic questions the participants were required to answer. The dataset's aim is to collect data on people's viewpoints on various feminisms and to investigate any possible patterns or trends in these viewpoints across demographics.
